LOADING DIALOG FEATURES:

- 3D box design with shading: front, top, and side faces
- Tape line detail for realistic appearance

- Fallback logic ensures brown package displays for apps without custom icons

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Search state maintained with atomic flags and result vectors
- In-memory search using g_allApps cache for performance
- Message processing every 10 categories and 50 apps during loading
- Timer-based spinner with Unicode rotation characters (◐ ◓ ◑ ◒)
- IDD_LOADING_DIALOG resource (250×65 pixels, centered)
- g_iconLoadingRunning flag removed - work done on main thread with message pumping

INTERNATIONALIZATION:
- Added "repopulating_table" field to Locale structure
- Updated locale files:
  * en_GB.txt: "Repopulating table..."
  * nb_NO.txt: "Fyller tabellen på nytt..."
